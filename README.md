“Due to the absence of a clear bimodal structure in speed distribution,
we adopted a conservative threshold (2.5 m/s) to define flight behavior,
prioritizing label precision over recall.”

“We adopted a temporal split strategy to evaluate the model’s ability
to predict future behavioral states from past observations,
avoiding information leakage in time-series data.”
